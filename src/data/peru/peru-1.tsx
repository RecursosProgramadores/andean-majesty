            description: "ARRIVE AT YOUR HOTEL IN LIMA AFTER YOUR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT AND TAKE TIME TO RELAX AND RECHARGE BEFORE YOUR FASCINATING CITY TOUR BEGINS!\n\nWe understand how exhausting international flights can be, so from the very moment you arrive in Peru, we ensure a seamless and stress-free experience. Upon landing at Lima Airport, your Machu Travel Peru host will be waiting for you at the arrivals gate to warmly welcome you and accompany you in private transfer to your selected hotel.\n\nOnce comfortably settled in your room, you may refresh with a relaxing shower and unwind after your long journey, or perhaps take the opportunity to savor Peru’s world-renowned cuisine with a delightful lunch (at your leisure) either at your hotel or in one of the nearby restaurants.\n\nLater, your discovery of the “City of Kings” begins with a fascinating exploration of Lima’s colonial and modern districts.\n\nStroll through elegant Republican and French-inspired squares such as Plaza San Martín and the historic Plaza de Armas, while walking along the charming colonial pedestrian street, Jirón de la Unión. Your expert guide will then lead you to the impressive Monastery of San Francisco, a masterpiece of Spanish Baroque architecture. Inside, admire remarkable colonial-era religious art before venturing beneath the monastery to explore its mysterious catacombs — once considered the first cemetery of Lima.\n\nAfter returning to your hotel, enjoy the afternoon at your own pace in the vibrant district of Miraflores. You may wish to walk through the lively Kennedy Park, admire the Pacific Ocean views, or browse the exclusive boutiques at Larcomar, Lima’s iconic clifftop shopping center.\n\nFor dinner, we highly recommend Central or Maido, both internationally acclaimed among the finest restaurants in the world. Central was ranked No. 1 in 2023, and Maido achieved No. 1 in 2025 on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list.

            description: "WELCOME TO CUSCO! EXPLORE THE TEXTILE HOUSE MUSEUM AND ITS LIVING TRADITIONS AND PISAC INCA NEIGHBORHOOD\n\nToday, your adventure in the Andean highlands begins.\n\nAfter enjoying a delightful breakfast at your hotel, your host will accompany you to Lima Airport for your comfortable flight to Cusco, the ancient Imperial City of the Incas.\n\nFrom your window seat, admire the dramatic transformation of Peru’s landscapes — the Pacific coastline blending into golden desert dunes, which gradually rise toward the majestic Andes, once traversed and mastered by the extraordinary Inca civilization centuries ago.\n\nUpon arrival in Cusco, your local host will warmly welcome you in the domestic arrivals area, holding a sign with your name. At 3,400 meters (11,150 ft) above sea level, Cusco’s altitude is certainly noticeable — yet, as we like to say, “It’s not altitude sickness… it’s the feeling of being closer to heaven.”\n\nTo ensure a smooth acclimatization, we will travel directly from the airport to the Sacred Valley of the Incas, located approximately 600 meters (2,000 ft) lower than Cusco. This gradual descent allows your body to adjust comfortably to the altitude. Rest assured, you will explore Cusco’s remarkable treasures later in your journey, once you are fully acclimatized.\n\nEn route to the Sacred Valley, you will visit an exceptional Textile House Museum. Here, you will encounter the four South American camelids — llamas, alpacas, guanacos, and vicuñas — and learn how to distinguish them. You may even feed them while discovering the importance of their fibers in Andean culture. Skilled artisans will demonstrate ancestral weaving techniques passed down from their Inca forebears, transforming delicate alpaca and vicuña fibers into exquisite, colorful garments. You will also observe the creation of multicolored belts, finely woven blankets, and beautifully embroidered textiles. A guided visit will further immerse you in the fascinating textile legacy of pre-Inca civilizations.\n\nContinuing through the valley, you will arrive at the impressive archaeological site of Pisac, majestically perched atop a hill. Admire its spectacular agricultural terraces cascading down the mountainside, along with ancient Inca temples, plazas, ceremonial structures, and even a hillside cemetery — your first profound encounter with the grandeur of the Andean world.\n\nDescending into the colonial town of Pisac, you will explore its vibrant traditional market, where colorful stalls showcase handcrafted treasures created by local artisans, including textiles, jewelry, ceramics, sculptures, and Andean-inspired artwork.\n\nAfterward, you will savor a delicious lunch at a charming restaurant nestled within the breathtaking landscapes of the Sacred Valley (included in your program). With the guidance of your travel consultants, you may select your preferred restaurant in advance to perfectly match your tastes.\n\nFinally, you will be transferred to your hotel, surrounded by the serene and spectacular scenery of the Sacred Valley. The evening is yours to relax and enjoy dinner at your leisure. A restful and well-deserved night awaits.\n\n• Overnight in Sacred Valley.\n• Included meals: Breakfast and Lunch."

With its privileged climate year-round, this region offers the perfect setting for an unforgettable day of exploration.\n\nAfter enjoying a delightful breakfast at your luxury hotel, you will set out with your private guide to continue your journey through the breathtaking Sacred Valley of the Incas.\n\nYour first stop will be Ollantaytambo, one of the most remarkable living Inca towns and the last stronghold of Inca resistance during the Spanish invasion. Wander through its narrow cobblestone streets, ancient temples, ceremonial plazas, and masterfully carved stone structures — each block perfectly fitted without mortar, a testament to the Incas’ extraordinary engineering skills. As you explore, your guide will bring the site to life with fascinating stories and legends, including the romantic tale of an Inca military general who fell in love with a beautiful princess, daughter of the great Emperor Pachacutec.\n\nNext, you will indulge in an exquisite lunch at a charming restaurant surrounded by the valley’s stunning landscapes. Crafted from fresh, locally sourced ingredients, your meal will delight you with a vibrant array of flavors, colors, and refined presentations — a true celebration of Andean gastronomy.\n\nYour journey continues to the dazzling salt mines of Maras, where nearly 2,000 small salt pools cascade down the mountainside in striking white formations. These salt pans, dating back to Inca times and still harvested by local families today, create a spectacular contrast against the surrounding landscape. Maras salt is internationally appreciated, particularly for its exceptional quality in gourmet cuisine and grilling.\n\nAfterward, you will visit the fascinating archaeological site of Moray. Here, a series of concentric circular terraces descend deep into the earth, forming what is believed to have been an Inca agricultural laboratory. Each level creates a distinct microclimate, allowing the Incas to experiment with crop adaptation and optimize agricultural production — a remarkable example of their advanced scientific knowledge.\n\nAt the end of this enriching day, you will return to your hotel for a well-deserved rest. You may choose to relax with a soothing shower, unwind amid the serene valley surroundings, or enjoy a delightful dinner at your leisure.\n\n• Overnight in Sacred Valley.\n• Included meals: Breakfast and Lunch."
