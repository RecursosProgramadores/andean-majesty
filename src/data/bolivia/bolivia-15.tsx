In this form, your body will acclimatize faster to the altitude.\n\nOnce installed in your room, you can take a comforting shower, leaving behind the fatigue of such a long flight and rest. Or, you can take advantage of the time to enjoy the best Bolivian gastronomy with a tasty lunch and dinner (on your own) in your hotel or the surrounding areas.
